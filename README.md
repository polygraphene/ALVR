# ALVR - Air Light VR

ALVR is an open source remote VR display for Gear VR and Oculus Go. With it, you can play SteamVR games in your standalone headset.

English | [Japanese](https://github.com/polygraphene/ALVR/blob/master/README-ja.md)

## Description

ALVR streams VR display output from your PC to Gear VR / Oculus Go via Wi-Fi. This is similar to Riftcat or Trinus VR, but our purpose is optimization for Gear VR. ALVR provides smooth head-tracking compared to other apps in a Wi-Fi environment using Asynchronous Timewarp.

Now, we have Gear VR / Oculus Go Controller support!

Note that many PCVR games require 6DoF controller or multiple buttons, so you might not able to play those games.
You can find playable games in [List of tested VR games and experiences](https://github.com/polygraphene/ALVR/wiki/List-of-tested-VR-games-and-experiences).

I have started crowdfunding about support for AMD GPU on [this page](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/59270271-will-we-get-an-amd-compatible-version-in-the-future). Also refer issue [#33](https://github.com/polygraphene/ALVR/issues/33).

- Better error correction for lost packets
- Better installer
